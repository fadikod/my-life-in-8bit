# 🎮 My Life in 8-Bit  
A retro-themed interactive web experience showcasing my personal journey across 8 levels.

---

## 🧭 Overview  
**My Life in 8-Bit** is a playful, game-inspired website built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It recreates the feel of classic 8-bit games while telling a story through scrolling levels, animations, banners, and interactive effects.

The project demonstrates clear understanding of fundamental programming concepts such as:

- **Events** (scroll triggers, keyboard interactions, click events)  
- **Loops** (repeating animations and update logic)  
- **Conditionals** (logic for cheat codes, HUD updates, visibility changes)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3** (retro styling, animations, HUD design, glitch effects)  
- **JavaScript** (event listeners, cheat codes, scroll logic, confetti effect)

## 🕹️ Cheat Codes  
The site includes hidden retro-style cheat codes that can be activated from the keyboard while the page is focused:

| Code Sequence | Effect |
|---------------|--------|
| **`iddqd`** | Activates **God Mode** – displays the “YOU HAVE TRANSCENDED STRESS – WELCOME, DEBUGGING GOD.” banner. |
| **`glitch`** | Enables **Glitch Mode** – triggers a glitchy visual effect on the entire page for 10 seconds. |
| **↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A** | Classic **Konami Code** – displays a special love banner and triggers a confetti celebration. |

These features make use of JavaScript keyboard event listeners, input buffers, conditionals, and timed CSS effects.
